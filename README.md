# Programmable Clock with Radio

## Overview
This project is a digital clock with a built-in programmable radio, designed using Logisim in my first year as a CS student at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. The circuit allows users to set the time, configure alarms, and open the radio.

## Features
- **Digital Clock**: Displays hours and minutes.
- **Programmable Alarms**: Allows users to set and manage alarms.
- **User Interface**: Buttons for setting time, configuring alarms, and turning on and off the radio.
- **Simulation in Logisim**: Designed and simulated using Logisim software.

## Requirements
- **Logisim**: The circuit was developed using Logisim. Ensure you have Logisim installed to open and run the project.
